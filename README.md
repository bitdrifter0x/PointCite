# PointCite


> Production-style enterprise document search & RAG platform — multi-tenant
> workspaces, hybrid keyword + vector retrieval, source-cited answers, and a
> BullMQ-backed ingestion pipeline.

This project demonstrates senior full-stack and AI-engineering work end to end:
authenticated workspaces, document ingestion with background workers, pgvector
similarity search fused with full-text keyword search, retrieval-augmented
answers with citations, and an operational dashboard.

Two long-running processes: the Next.js app (HTTP) and a separate BullMQ worker
(`pnpm worker`). They share the Postgres database and Redis queue.

## Quick start

### 1. Start the stack

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
```

The default Compose stack builds the production image, runs `app-migrate`
(`pnpm db:setup`), starts the Next.js app on <http://localhost:3000>, and runs
the BullMQ worker. The app healthcheck is exposed at `/api/health`.

**Demo login:** `demo@pointcite.dev` / `pointcite-demo`

Optional profiles:

```bash
# optional: local LLM/embeddings
docker compose --profile ollama up -d ollama
docker exec -it $(docker ps -qf name=ollama) ollama pull nomic-embed-text
docker exec -it $(docker ps -qf name=ollama) ollama pull gemma3:4b
# optional: S3-compatible storage for uploads
docker compose --profile s3 up -d minio minio-create-bucket
```

### Local development

For faster iterative development on macOS or Windows, run dependencies in
Compose and the app on the host:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
pnpm install
pnpm db:setup       # db push + pgvector + index + seed demo data
pnpm dev
pnpm worker
```

`db:setup` creates tables, applies the pgvector/FTS indexes, and seeds demo data.

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Notable:

| Var                  | Purpose                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL`       | Postgres connection (must have `pgvector` available).    |
| `REDIS_URL`          | Redis for BullMQ.                                        |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Server secret for cookie/session signing.                |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND`    | `local` by default; set `s3` for S3/R2/MinIO-compatible object storage. |
| `STORAGE_DIR`        | Local upload root when using `STORAGE_BACKEND=local`.    |
| `S3_*`               | Endpoint, region, bucket and credentials for the S3 backend. |
| `INTERNAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` | Comma-separated emails allowed into internal operator tools. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | Optional. Enables Claude Agent SDK chat.                 |
| `RERANKER`           | `none` by default; `cohere`, `voyage`, or `ollama` reranks Ask retrieval. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Enables OpenTelemetry trace export when set, e.g. `http://localhost:4317`. |
| `OLLAMA_HOST`        | Defaults to `http://localhost:11434`.                    |
| `EMBEDDING_DIM`      | Must match the `vector(N)` column in `schema.prisma`.    |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`   | Per-file upload size limit.                              |

## Ingestion pipeline

```
upload → POST /api/documents
       → saveUpload (local FS or S3-compatible object storage)
       → Document row {status: uploaded}
       → enqueueIngest(documentId)
worker  ← BullMQ "ingest" queue
        → extractText (pdf-parse / mammoth / utf-8)
        → chunkText  (~2000 chars, paragraph-aware, 200-char overlap)
        → embedTexts (Ollama nomic-embed-text → mock)
        → INSERT chunks + vectors (single transaction, raw SQL for pgvector)
        → Document {status: indexed, ingestDurationMs}
        → IngestJob {state: completed}
```

Failures: BullMQ retries 3× with exponential backoff. Final failure flips
`Document.status = failed` and writes the error message. The Documents and Jobs
pages surface one-click **Retry** actions, including **Retry all failed** on the
Jobs page.

Bull Board is mounted at `/internal/bull` for workspace owners and emails in
`INTERNAL_ADMIN_EMAILS`. It exposes the raw `ingest` queue, including delayed,
stalled, failed, and Redis-level queue details. The Jobs table links each BullMQ
job id to its Bull Board detail page.

OpenTelemetry tracing is disabled unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set.
When enabled, PointCite emits Next.js auto-instrumentation plus manual spans for
`ingest.job`, `ingest.extract`, `ingest.chunk`, `ingest.embed.batch`,
`ingest.insert`, `search.keyword`, `search.vector`, `search.fuse`,
`ask.retrieve`, `ask.llm`, and `ask.persist`. BullMQ jobs carry `traceparent`
metadata so worker ingestion spans continue the upload request trace.

Local Jaeger:

```bash
docker compose --profile observability up -d jaeger
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 pnpm dev
```

Jaeger UI opens at <http://localhost:16686>.

## Search architecture

Three modes on `POST /api/search`:

- **keyword** — Postgres `to_tsvector('english', text) @@ websearch_to_tsquery`
  ranked by `ts_rank`. Uses the `chunk_text_fts` GIN index.
- **vector** — pgvector cosine distance (`embedding <=> query_vector`), HNSW
  index for ANN.
- **hybrid** (default) — top-25 of each, fused with reciprocal rank fusion
  (k = 60).

All queries are scoped by `workspaceId` in the WHERE clause — there is no path
by which a chunk from another workspace can appear in a result.

---

## Storage backends

Uploads go through `src/lib/storage`, which selects an adapter with
`STORAGE_BACKEND`.

- `local` stores files under `STORAGE_DIR` and records `Document.storagePath` as
  a relative filesystem path such as `workspaceId/object-name.pdf`.
- `s3` streams uploads through the Next.js server to any S3-compatible API and
  records `Document.storagePath` as `s3://bucket/key`.
- `azure` is reserved for a later adapter and fails fast if selected.

For local MinIO testing:

```bash
docker compose --profile s3 up -d minio minio-create-bucket
```

Then set:

```env
STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=pointcite
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=pointcite
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=pointcite-secret
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
```

---

## RAG flow

`POST /api/ask` (`Ask` page) does:

1. Hybrid search top-6 chunks for the question.
2. Compose a system prompt + numbered context block.
3. Optionally rerank the fused top-20 chunks (`RERANKER=cohere|voyage|ollama`)
   before taking the final context window.
4. Call the chat provider chain.
5. Persist the (`question`, `answer`, citations, model, provider,
   retrievalScore, retrievalMs, rerankMs, llmMs) row in `Question`.
6. Return the answer plus citations and full context text for the UI.

Citations render directly under the answer with score + filename + chunk
number, so any sentence can be verified against its source.

---

## Provider chain

Embeddings and chat use ordered fallback chains. The first provider that
succeeds wins; on failure or unavailability the next provider is tried.

**Embeddings:**

1. Ollama `nomic-embed-text` (768 dim) — used when `/api/tags` responds.
2. Deterministic SHA-256-derived mock vector — always available.

**Chat:**

1. **Claude Agent SDK** (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) when
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set.
2. **Ollama `gemma3:4b`** local model when reachable.
3. **Mock** — returns the top retrieved chunks as a labelled `[DEMO MODE]`
   answer, so the UI always renders something usable.

**Rerankers:**

Reranking is off by default for raw `/api/search` and on for `/api/ask`.
`search()` accepts `{ rerank: true }` when callers want the second stage.

| Provider | Env | Tradeoff | Approximate cost shape |
|----------|-----|----------|------------------------|
| None | `RERANKER=none` | Zero latency/cost; preserves RRF order. | Free. |
| Cohere | `RERANKER=cohere` + `COHERE_API_KEY` | Strong hosted cross-encoder with simple search-unit billing. | One search unit for a top-20 rerank. Cohere defines one unit as one query over up to 100 ranked documents, with long docs counted as chunks. |
| Voyage | `RERANKER=voyage` + `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | Hosted reranker with large-context models. | Token-based: query tokens are counted once per document plus document tokens; top-20 short chunks are typically a small fraction of 1M tokens. |
| Ollama | `RERANKER=ollama` | Local/private if an Ollama-compatible rerank endpoint is available. | No API fee; pays local CPU/GPU time. |

The chain means the project runs end-to-end with **no paid API keys** and
without an internet connection (set up Ollama with `gemma3` and
`nomic-embed-text` for real models, or accept the deterministic mock for tests).

## Security & tenant isolation

- Every API route resolves the caller's user via better-auth and the **current
  workspace** via `requireCurrentWorkspace()`. There is no path to query another
  workspace's data.
- All SQL — including the raw vector and full-text queries — joins on
  `workspaceId` so an attacker manipulating a chunk id cannot fetch foreign
  data.
- Uploaded files are size-checked (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`) and type-checked against
  an allowlist of MIMEs / extensions.
- Storage paths are workspace-prefixed and stem-sanitised before being written.
- Per-user token-bucket rate limits on upload / search / ask / retry; 429 with
  `Retry-After` + `X-RateLimit-*` headers. Configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_*` env.
- Per-IP anonymous limits on sign-in / sign-up / password reset / verification
  resend / public invitation lookup. `TRUST_PROXY=1` enables `X-Forwarded-For`
  / `Forwarded` parsing; without it the limiter falls back to a single shared
  bucket to refuse spoofed identities.
- Email verification (opt-in via `BETTER_AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true`)
  and password reset both go through the email provider chain (#22). Reset
  links expire in 1 hour, verify links in 24 hours.
- **Prompt-injection guard** (`src/lib/rag/sanitise.ts`) inspects every
  retrieved chunk before it reaches the LLM, flags risky patterns
  (`ignore_previous`, `role_directive`, `tag_break`, `boundary_marker`,
  `long_base64`, `hidden_unicode`) and either warns, strips or blocks based on
  `RAG_INJECTION_MODE`. Each chunk is wrapped in a `<source warnings="...">`
  block in the prompt so the model has explicit metadata about untrusted input,
  and the Ask page surfaces flags as badges next to each citation.
- Secrets never reach the client: only `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and public Next.js
  values are exposed.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test            # Vitest unit suite (≈ 60 tests, sub-second)
pnpm test:coverage   # with v8 coverage
pnpm test:e2e        # Playwright smoke (signup → upload → ingest → search → ask)
```

Unit tests cover the chunker, RRF fusion, provider chain demotion, streaming
chain demotion, the rate-limit Lua semantics, the RBAC rank helper, both Zod
schemas, the workspace auth helpers, and the deterministic mock embeddings.

The Playwright smoke is a local-only check. It spins up the dev server **and**
the BullMQ worker via Playwright's `webServer` array; both processes are torn
down when the run finishes. CI lives at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs the
unit suite against Postgres + Redis service containers.

---

## Known limitations

- **DOCX path** depends on `mammoth`; complex Word features (tables, images)
  are dropped to plain text.
- **Server-mediated uploads** still route through the Next.js app before
  reaching local disk or S3. Browser-to-object-storage presigned uploads are a
  later milestone.
- **Invitation emails** are real via Resend or SMTP when configured; the
  default `console` provider logs the email to stdout for dev. Email
  verification + password reset wiring through better-auth is `#14`.
- **Embedding model swaps** require a full re-ingest until #17 lands.

## Future improvements

- Workspace switcher and invitations UI.
- Streaming RAG answers (SSE) and inline citation highlighting on hover.
- Re-ranker pass over the fused top-N before sending to the LLM.
- Per-document delete from search index without re-running the worker.
